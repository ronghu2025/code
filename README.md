# ALL files were served for analysing carotenogenic genes in insects.

The codes in file BLASTp.sh is used to perform BLASTp analysis.

The codes in file MLtree_construction.sh is used to construct MLtrees.

The codes in file Data_processing.ipynb is used to process data.

The zip file proteion_sequence_fasta_file.zip record the protein FASTA files of carotenogenic genes.

The zip file motif_fasta_files.zip record the protein FASTA files constructed in motif analysis.

The zip file qPCR_raw_data.zip record the qPCR raw data in experiments of detecting carotenogenic gene expressions.
